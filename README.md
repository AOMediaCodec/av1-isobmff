# av1-isobmff
Official specification of the AOM group for the carriage of AV1 in ISOBMFF

The specification is written using a special syntax (mixing markup and markdown) 
to enable generation of cross-references, syntax highlighting, etc. The file using this syntax is index.bs.

index.bs is processed to produce an HTML version (index.html) by a tool
called Bikeshed (https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).

The repository contains both the input and the result of the Bikeshed processing. 

Pull requests should contain updates to both files index.html and index.bs.
